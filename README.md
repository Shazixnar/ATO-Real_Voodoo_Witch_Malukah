<summary>Traits</summary>

### Level 3

Jinx: When dealing damage with a Hit, apply 2 Dark and Poison. Regeneration on heroes increases Shadow damage by 0.5 per charge.

Healing Brew: All heroes gain +0.2 and +0.2% to All damage done and Heal reveived for every 9 hp above 120 hp they have. When you play a \"Healing Spell\" or \"Shadow Spell\" card that costs Energy, refund 1 Energy and grant 2 Regeneration and 1 Vitality to the lowest HP hero. (3 times/turn).

### Level 5

Shadow Form: Dark and Poison +2. Dark on monsters explosion charges charges +5 and deals 0.5 more damage per charge.

Mojo: Regeneration +1, Vitality +1, Max charge is 75. When you play a \"Healing Spell\" card, Dispel 1 to all heroes.

PS: I modify the logic of increasing dark explosion stack. Now **The Dark One** and other equipment can stack together.

e.g. Team have **The Dark One** and **Black Deck**, Malukah choice Shadow Form trait, so Dark on enemies will explode at 25+9+5+5 = 44 stack.

<summary>Perks</summary>

### Perks

The fourth Sharp: Sharp on heroes also increases the Shadow damage by 1 per charge. ( Right, I change it back )

The third Regeneration: Regeneration on heroes also increases all resistance by 0.5% per charge and increases Max HP by 1 per charge.

The first Vitality: Vitality on heroes instead increases Max HP by 8 per charge.

And the third Dark's description.

I'll be modifying this data frequently to make balance. So the picture maybe isn't the true number. You can check them out at the Town of Knowledge in game.

## Support

I will keep watching for cards strength, try to make sure these cards display their strength that should be there.

Malukah has two way now. One is the dangerous Witch who curse enemies badly and let her team have power of shadow too. The other way is kindness Witch who use her mojo make team more vibrant.
